Intro
=====
These are a set of altered weapon variables for Red Eclipse. Their purpose is to attempt to alter how the weapons are used in combat.
Although I have tried to balance these as best I can, there are probably some things that need to be fixed or worked out. Please let me know if you find them.
I have created two sets, one of which works in Red Eclipse 1.4, the other in the latest SVN (1.4.9) Please note that 1.4.5 has not been used or tested by me.

Installing
==========
Once you have the file downloaded, open up the zip and go inside the ExtraVars-master folder. Place the config files to where the others, such as autoexec.cfg, are stored on your system (You can check the wiki for that information). Once you have the cfg files properly placed, you can run "/exec extravars14.cfg" in-game if you use the 1.4 version, or "/extravars149.cfg" in-game if you use the 1.4.9 SVN version.
Feel free to use autoexec.cfg if you know how.
